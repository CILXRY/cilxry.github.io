## How to run this project localy?

this project's package manager is `pnpm`, so that, you should use these commands:

> if you havn't pnpm installion yet?
> Install by npm: `npm install -g pnpm`, or by system's package manager, such here is Arch Linux:`sudo pacman -S pnpm`.

You should install depentions when you first run this project:`pnpm i` or `pnpm install`

And here are the other commands:

| Command                  | What to do                                     |
